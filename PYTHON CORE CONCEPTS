What is a Function in Python?
A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task and runs only when it is called.
Functions help avoid code repetition and make programs easier to manage.

Simple Function Example
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")


What is a Parameter in Python?
A parameter is a variable written inside a function definition that receives data when the function is called.
📌 Parameters act as placeholders for values.
Code Example (Parameter)
def greet(name):      # name → parameter
    print("Hello", name)
name has no value yet
It waits for input when the function is called

What is an Argument in Python?
An argument is the actual value passed to a function when the function is called.
📌 Arguments provide real data to parameters.
 Code Example (Argument)
greet("Nidhi")   


HR wants to greet different employees using the same system.
Code Example
def greet_employee(employee_name):     # parameter
    print("Hello", employee_name)

employee_name = input("Enter employee name: ")
greet_employee(employee_name)          # argument

### A function is a reusable block of code. Parameters are variables defined in a function to receive data, and arguments are the actual values passed when calling the function.####
### Functions are reusable in Python because they allow developers to define logic once and execute it multiple times with different inputs using parameters.

What Are Decorators in python ? 
A decorator in Python is a function that adds extra behavior to another function without changing its original code.
📌 In short:
Decorator = extra feature added to an existing function
A decorator is a function that modifies another function by adding extra functionality without changing its source code.


SYNTAX:: def decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Before function")
        func()
        print("After function")
    return wrapper


**Reverse A String :** 
through python slicing : 
s = input()  #take input form user **()call the function**
print(s[::-1])
string[start : end : step]
Here:
start → not given (start from the end )
end → not given (go till the begining)
step → -1 (move backwards)
 So [::-1] means:
“Take the entire string and read it from right to left.”

now so without using the slicing ::
s = input()
rev = ""
for ch in s:
    rev = ch + rev

print(rev)



#Check if the string is palindrome or not 
s = input ()
rev = ""
for ch in s:
    rev = ch + rev
if s == rev:
   print("palindrome")
else:
   print("not palindorme")


#count the vowel in the string 
s = input()
count = 0
for ch in s:
      if ch in "aeiouAEIOU":
            count += 1
     
print(count)


**Count the cons. in the string**

s = input()
count = 0

for ch in s:
if ch.isalpha() and ch not in "aeiouAEIOU":
count += 1

print(count)


n = int(input())
if n <= 1:
    print("not a prime number")
else:
        for i in range(2 ,n):
            if n % i == 0:
                  print("not a prime number")
                  break
        else:
            print("prime number")


#Check whether Number is Even OR ODD 
n = int(input())
if n % 2 == 0:
    print("even")
else:
    print("odd")



#What is fibonici Series? Also Write a program in python .
Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where:
Each number is the sum of the previous two numbers.

n = int(input())

a = 0
b = 1

for i in range(n):
    print(a, end=" ")
    c = a + b
    a = b
    b = c

#Swap the number with using third variable 
a = int(input())
b = int(input())

a = 5
b = 10
temp = a 
a = b
b = temp


#Swap a variable without using third variable 

a = int(input())
b = int(input())

a = a+b
b = a-b
a= a-b

print(a, b)
