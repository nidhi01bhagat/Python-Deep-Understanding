What is a Function in Python?
A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task and runs only when it is called.
Functions help avoid code repetition and make programs easier to manage.

Simple Function Example
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")


What is a Parameter in Python?
A parameter is a variable written inside a function definition that receives data when the function is called.
📌 Parameters act as placeholders for values.
Code Example (Parameter)
def greet(name):      # name → parameter
    print("Hello", name)
name has no value yet
It waits for input when the function is called

What is an Argument in Python?
An argument is the actual value passed to a function when the function is called.
📌 Arguments provide real data to parameters.
 Code Example (Argument)
greet("Nidhi")   


HR wants to greet different employees using the same system.
Code Example
def greet_employee(employee_name):     # parameter
    print("Hello", employee_name)

employee_name = input("Enter employee name: ")
greet_employee(employee_name)          # argument

### A function is a reusable block of code. Parameters are variables defined in a function to receive data, and arguments are the actual values passed when calling the function.####
### Functions are reusable in Python because they allow developers to define logic once and execute it multiple times with different inputs using parameters.

What Are Decorators in python ? 
A decorator in Python is a function that adds extra behavior to another function without changing its original code.
📌 In short:
Decorator = extra feature added to an existing function
A decorator is a function that modifies another function by adding extra functionality without changing its source code.


SYNTAX:: def decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Before function")
        func()
        print("After function")
    return wrapper
