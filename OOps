What is Object Oriented Programming?

“OOPS is a programming approach used to solve real-world problems efficiently by using objects.”
Because:
Objects represent real entities
Objects contain data + behavior
Objects interact to complete tasks

Difference Between Pop and Oop ?
“POP focuses on functions operating on data, while OOPS focuses on objects that combine data and behavior, making applications easier to manage.”
