What is Object Oriented Programming?

“OOPS is a programming approach used to solve real-world problems efficiently by using objects.”
Because:
Objects represent real entities
Objects contain data + behavior
Objects interact to complete tasks

Example : In a bank, each customer account is treated as an object.
The account has data like balance and actions like deposit and withdraw.
Keeping data and actions together helps manage the system easily. This is OOPS.

Difference Between Pop and Oop ?
“POP focuses on functions operating on data, while OOPS focuses on objects that combine data and behavior, making applications easier to manage.”
